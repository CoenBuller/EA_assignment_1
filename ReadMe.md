## Setup environment

It is recommended to create a virtual environment:

- **bash:** python -m venv <environment name>

After that you can install all the dependencies through the "requirements.txt" file with the following command:

- **bash:** pip install -r requirements.txt

If you add a package to your environment, pls update the "requirements.txt" file by running the following command and pushing it to the repository:

- **bash:** python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
